Title: eBuilders Project

Description: This flask run app is a way to keep track of projects, managers and clients for a construction company. Simple as that.

ENDPOINTS: I used GET, POST and DELETE. I would like to implement a POST for projects and clients and possibly a PUT for all of these tables as well.

1. How did the project's design evolve over time?
I started with a lot more tables (subs and vendors tables) but that was a LOT of data to input in such a short time. I'm working on designing the app to have these tables as well.

2. Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?
I chose the ORM approach because I didn't understand it very well and wanted to work with it more so that I could learn it in more depth.

3. What future improvements are in store, if any?
Subs and Vendors tables so that the managers can keep track of which sub-contractor's and vendor's materials they are using on each respective project. Also a POST and PUT endpoint for every table.
